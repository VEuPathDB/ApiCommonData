             <br>Mass spectrometry data were obtained from two-dimensional gel electrophoretic protein separations, one-dimensional gel LC-MS/MS and 
             MudPIT analysis of a sporozoite/oocyst excystation mixture of <i>Cryptosporidium parvum</i>.  A total of approximately 3,500 protein 
             hits were obtained resulting in 1,252 non-redundant protein identifications. In addition a further 100 hits were obtained to sequences 
             which matched a predicted open reading frame, but for which no gene model currently exists. In total these protein identifications 
             represent nearly one third of the entire predicted proteome of <i>C. parvum</i>, although it is unlikely that the entire proteome 
             from all life-stages will be expressed at any one time.

             Enriched cytoskeletal and membrane fractions were separated by 1D-SDS-PAGE or 2D gel electrophoresis. The bands/spots were digested with trypsin. The resulting peptides analyzed by nanoLC-MS/MS on a ThermoFinnigan linear ion trap (LTQ) mass spectrometer.  MASCOT was used to search the merged DTA mass spectrometry data file against the appropriate database to obtained unique peptide hits.  In order to extend the dynamic range of the membrane fractions, high pH sodium carbonate was used to remove the peripheral membrane proteins. For a few experiments, the remaining cytosolic fractions were also analyzed.

             <i>Data provided by Belinda Ferrari and Quach Truong at the Department of Biological Sciences, Macquarie University, Sydney, Australia.</i><br><br>
Subcellular proteomic analysis of <i>C. parvum</i> oocysts. Proteome analysis was carried out on two components of the oocyst after excystation. (1) the proteins identified in the sporozoites and (2) the proteins identified belonging to residual oocyst wall.  Furthermore, proteome analysis was also carried on the intact oocyst.  Consequently, the aim of this study was to identify proteins unique to each subcellular component, and also to identify proteins shared between fractions.

             Mass spectrometry data were obtained from one-dimensional gel LC-MS/MS and MudPIT analysis of Toxoplasma gondii tachyzoites. 6,546 protein hits were obtained resulting in 2217 non-redundant protein identifications. A further 318 hits were obtained to sequences which matched 226 predicted open reading frames for which no gene model currently exists.  Additionally, 163 gene predictions were hit that did not have an overlapping gene model to which at least 50% of the peptides could be mapped.  In total these protein identifications from one stage represent nearly one third of the entire predicted proteome of T. gondii.

             <br>Enriched cytoskeletal and membrane fractions of T. gondii were separated by 1D-SDS-PAGE or 2D gel electrophoresis.  The bands/spots were digested with trypsin. The resulting peptides analyzed by nanoLC-MS/MS on a ThermoFinnigan linear ion trap (LTQ) mass spectrometer.  MASCOT was used to search the merged DTA mass spectrometry data file against the appropriate database to obtained unique peptide hits.  In order to extend the dynamic range of the membrane fractions, high pH sodium carbonate was used to remove the peripheral membrane proteins. For a few experiments, the remaining cytosolic fractions were also analyzed. A total of 2604 proteins were identified by mass spectrometry in T. gondii to date.

Subcellular proteomic analysis of <i>C. parvum</i> oocysts. Proteome analysis was carried out on two components of the oocyst after excystation. (1) the proteins identified in the sporozoites and (2) the proteins identified belonging to residual oocyst wall.  Furthermore, proteome analysis was also carried on the intact oocyst.  Consequently, the aim of this study was to identify proteins unique to each subcellular component, and also to identify proteins shared between fractions.
