/* rules from Hilary Morrison 
Subsumed Genes:

1) One annotated, one hypothetical: keep annotated gene.
	In all but 30 cases, the annotated gene is the longer of the pair.
	Exceptions include tRNAs, ribosomal proteins.
2) Both hypothetical: keep longer of pair.

Exceptions that should be examined (these are rare in Subsumed Genes set):

Any case where both are annotated: how good is annotation?
	GL50803_27446494, Calmodulin antisense orf and GL50803_5333, Calmodulin overlap: retain both (Fran Gillin)
	GL50803_303542129, Kinase, NEK and GL50803_35985, HCP (Adrian Hehl; Fran Gillin)
	GL50803_6835, Brix domain containing protein and GL50803_37434, ditto: weak evidence, retain longer
	GL50803_11992, TCP-1 cpn and GL50803_38134, Thermosome beta: weak evidence for thermosome beta; retain TCP-1.

Hypothetical proteins longer than 400 aas
	GL50803_112080 is overlapped by alpha tubulin, but has SAGE evidence, TMM, and signal peptide: should retain both.
	GL50803_104186 is overlapped by very small annotated protein: should retain both.

-------------------------------------------------------
Overlapping Genes:

*Overlap by tRNAs or rRNAs should not be considered--keep all these and any overlapping proteins (11 cases).*

Exclude all overlapping genes that are both hypothetical proteins and shorter than 100 aas

Remainder should be considered according to different criteria depending on the annotation, topology of the overlap, and length of gene to be removed

Genes that are flagged for removal but larger than 300 aas should be examined before final decision

1) Same orientation

a) both genes hypothetical proteins: keep longer of the pair if either percentage overlap is greater than 25 or overlap length is greater than 99.  If the percentage overlap is less than 25 and overlap length is less than or equal to 99, keep both (this eliminates 106 of 170 in this group; 12 of these have signal peptides).

b) one gene hypothetical protein: keep the annotated protein.  If the percentage overlap is less than 25 and overlap length is less than or equal to 99, keep both (this eliminates 66 of 119 in this group; 7 of these have signal peptides).

c) both annotated: keep both UNLESS percentage > 25 AND overlap length > 99 (eliminates 7 of 34 in this group; the 7 are likely to be frame shift errors).

2) opposite orientation, overlap is at end of proteins (stop codon)

a) both genes hypothetical proteins: keep longer of the pair if either percentage overlap is greater than 25 or overlap length is greater than 99.  Keep both otherwise (eliminates 96 of 147; 9 have signal peptides)

b) one gene hypothetical protein: keep the annotated protein.  If the percentage overlap is less than 25 and overlap length is less than or equal to 99, keep both (this eliminates 149 of 220 cases in this group; 17 of these have signal peptides vs. 5/71 in genes that were retained.).

c) both annotated: keep longer of the pair if either percentage overlap is greater than 25 or overlap length is greater than 99.  Keep both otherwise.  *There is only one example where an annotated protein is flagged for deletion based on these criteria*.

3) opposite orientation, overlap is a start of proteins (start codon)

a) both genes hypothetical proteins:  If percent > 25 AND overlap > 99, keep longer only.  Otherwise, keep both (eliminates 102/162 cases; many others would be caught by 100aa rule)

b) one gene hypothetical protein: If percent > 25 AND overlap > 99, keep annotated only.  Otherwise, keep both (136 of 225)

c) both annotated: keep both.
