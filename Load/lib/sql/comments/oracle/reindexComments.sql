-- reindexComments.sql

-- truncate and reload apidb.TextSearchableComment. This will ensure that it is
-- in sync with the Comments / CommentStableId / CommentReference tables, which
-- are the primary home of comments. (We can't simply point text search at those
-- because Oracle Text wants to index and search a single column.)

-- In the past, it was necessary to do this from time to time to bring
-- TextSearchableComment back into sync because the triggers on the comments
-- tables did not handle updates or deletes. We're installing triggers that do,
-- but keeping this script around for the transition and as a fallback.

-- Note that the expression SELECTed into TextSearchableComment must be kept in
-- sync with those in the triggers, which live in searchableCommentText.sql
